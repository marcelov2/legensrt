1
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,333
Higher...

2
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,208
Higher...

3
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,542
Higher.

4
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,708
Higher.

5
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,875
Higher.

6
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,167
Higher.

7
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,208
What?

8
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,417
Who is it?

9
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:43,708
Let go of me!

10
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,375
Who is it?

11
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,833
Where... where am I?

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,750
Hey!

13
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,708
You're alive.

14
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,333
Let me make you feel alive.

15
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:45,708
《Dangerous Drugs of Sex》

16
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,583
Easy. You have to relax.

17
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,375
Stop

18
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,125
I'm not gonna stop.

19
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,833
Stop!

20
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,458
I said I won't stop.

21
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:42,208
I'm gonna find you all your best spots.

22
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,042
Stop! It's itchy!

23
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,917
Stop, you freak...

24
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,833
Fre...

25
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,750
Stop! Freak!

26
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,875
Freak!

27
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,833
Freak... Freak...

28
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,292
Freak! Freak! Freak!

29
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:24,208
Ah... freak...

30
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,042
Freak...

31
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,000
Freak...

32
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,208
That's all you have to say?

33
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,708
Then I'm gonna continue.

34
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,042
No... Ah... I've to go to toilet.

35
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,958
Please let me go to toilet.

36
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,000
Liar.

37
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,708
You see, there's nothing in your bladder.

38
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:58,792
What?

39
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,750
I took a shower for you when you passed out.
I got everything out of you.

40
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,875
Here too.

41
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,125
Nothing inside.

42
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,417
You're just empty now.

43
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,500
Your life is mine now.

44
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,667
You don't have to understand.

45
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,833
Just take in everything i give you.

46
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,833
What's that?

47
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
Enemagra.

48
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,250
It's a great invention by a urologist.

49
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,583
Very effective for stimulating prostate.

50
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,500
See... you're getting hard.

51
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,875
I'm... not...

52
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,917
It's in your instinct...

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,208
You want to live...

54
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,875
So hot... you can't escape from such ecstacy

55
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,792
because you can't move, huh?

56
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:45,833
Don't worry, you'll have so many
chances to get there again.

57
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,625
So... hot...

58
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,333
Pull it... pull it out!

59
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,208
I'm not gonna run... I'm not gonna run!

60
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,042
I'll die...

61
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:11,250
I'll die... I'm gonna die...

62
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,917
You're living your moment!

63
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:25,000
No, no... no...

64
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,792
Mr. Katsuragi...

65
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,500
Chief?

66
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,458
Chief?

67
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,417
It's dream...

68
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,667
You're too tired.

69
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,208
Sorry. You finished?

70
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,333
Yeah.

71
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,458
You stayed up late again yesterday,
didn't you?

72
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,458
You should take some rest.

73
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,583
You're gonna do it for me?

74
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,292
I can't!

75
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,542
I'm gonna have my rest after this is done.

76
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,292
There might already be an answer for you.

77
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,625
Boss' looking for you.

78
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,083
The proposal passed.

79
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,417
Really?

80
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,458
You did a great job.

81
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,958
Thank you very much.

82
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,708
I should be the one saying thank you.

83
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,917
This is a big event since foundation.

84
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,667
Leader of this project...

85
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,125
can you do it?

86
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,542
It's my pleasure.

87
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
Don't feel too good about yourself yet.

88
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,250
You can go even higher.

89
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,792
I see.

90
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,958
What is it, Mom?

91
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,250
What happened?

92
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,417
Just we haven't been eating with you
for a long time.

93
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,125
I want it to be nice.

94
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,708
Sorry, I have been busy.

95
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,792
Don't push yourself too hard.

96
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,417
It's all nothing if you died.

97
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,917
Don't say that!

98
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,500
Come on, sit.

99
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,042
Right, before dinner,
I want you to have this.

100
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,292
I got a bonus.

101
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,917
You two should go on a travel sometimes.

102
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,208
What are you talking about, so much!?

103
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,958
Just take it.

104
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,458
Thank you, Makoto.

105
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,958
You're welcome.
I should be the one thanking you having me.

106
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,750
That's enough.

107
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,542
Sake.

108
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,250
Ok.

109
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,542
It feels like a dream, haha.

110
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,708
Dream.

111
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:45,917
It's a dream.

112
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,458
It's not a dream.

113
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,708
Morning.

114
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,792
Didn't we say you can't run?

115
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,625
Nutrition and water needed for a day.

116
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,500
And vitamin.

117
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,750
Who's gonna...

118
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,833
You think it's poison?

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,167
Starved to death is very painful, I tell you.

120
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,042
Much more painful than
jumping down from a building.

121
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,625
I'm not going to kill you.

122
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,458
My job is to save people.

123
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,083
No...

124
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,417
It's from you Dad.

125
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,958
He's called several times.

126
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,083
What is it?

127
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,833
They are coming back from Okinawa today.

128
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,333
The trip you gave them as a gift?

129
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,542
You're such a good son.

130
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,083
I promised to pick them up at the airport.

131
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,417
But you promised you will stay the night.

132
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,167
Sorry, I forgot.

133
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,125
"Are you busy at work?"

134
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,625
"We can take taxi ourselves.
You don't have to come."

135
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,125
They said.

136
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,667
Oh I fucked up.

137
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,708
You bad son.

138
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,542
Just stay the night with me.

139
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,208
Sorry.

140
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,708
Hey, don't run.

141
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,583
My name is Katsuragi.

142
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,042
Please follow me.

143
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,458
The taxi ran into a truck.

144
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,875
When arrived at the hospital,
they've already...

145
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,917
Are you okay, Mr. Katsuragi?

146
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,458
Breathe slowly.

147
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:17,750
My... it's all my fault....

148
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,750
My fault.

149
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,458
My fault.

150
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,750
My fault.

151
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,000
My...

152
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,417
My...

153
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,125
Calmer after eating, right?

154
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,875
You had some sleep, huh?

155
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,458
What?

156
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,792
You haven't ejaculated, right?

157
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,542
You have to at least ejaculate once...

158
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:08,917
Relax.

159
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,875
Hey, there's no way to put it in...

160
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,875
How is it? Feel good?

161
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,583
No... how can it feel good...

162
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,500
You sure? Just like that..

163
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:09,958
If I stop here, it will feel like
burning down here, no?

164
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,792
No...

165
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,125
I heard that.

166
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,417
You want to shoot... just a little bit more...

167
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:24,208
Deeper... you want to shoot...

168
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,958
You want to shoot...
You want to shoot...

169
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,458
You want to shoot...
You want to shoot...

170
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,875
You want to shoot...

171
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,792
Your waist is shaking.

172
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:44,792
See.

173
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,917
Feels good, huh?

174
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:56,000
No... my nipples...

175
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,083
Want to shoot?

176
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,667
Go ahead.

177
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,292
It's no good to hold it

178
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,958
No... I can't like this...

179
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,542
Yeah? This is not enough?

180
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,292
You're shaking yourself.

181
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,208
Coming... it's coming...

182
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,958
It's out...

183
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,208
One more.

184
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,458
Please stop.

185
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,417
Shut up.

186
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,458
I can't sell you anymore.

187
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,625
Huh?

188
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please don't move.

189
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,958
Please go home.

190
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,375
Hey, where's my wallet?

191
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,667
There.

192
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,750
Mr. Katsuragi?

193
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:56,458
Don't take it the wrong way.
We were just having dinner together.

194
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,667
I couldn't recognize you.

195
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,500
You've changed a lot, Mr. Katsuragi.

196
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:06,375
I've called you many times.

197
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,917
It's too over absent without
notice for over a month.

198
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,083
You should come to the office.

199
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
They say you'll get your severance.

200
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:24,250
Weird... my hair's longer...

201
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,083
It dosn't matter anymore.

202
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,333
You are to achieve higher.

203
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,958
Higher...

204
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,792
Higher...

205
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,583
Higher...

206
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,083
Higher...

207
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,208
Higher...

208
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,167
Higher...

209
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,750
Higher...

210
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,958
Higher...

211
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,125
Higher..

212
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,000
Who is it...

213
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,917
You want to die that bad?

214
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,625
I want to die.

215
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,125
If you're throwing your life away,

216
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:21,292
how about give it to me.

217
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,042
You're clean now.

218
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,500
Good view.

219
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,250
Don't struggle...
you're gonna hurt your knees.

220
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,958
Leave me alone! Hey!

221
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,625
Told you not to move.

222
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,833
Stop.

223
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,917
Hey, stop.

224
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,250
Stop.

225
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:11,958
This is... the arteria carotis.

226
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,708
Good..nice boy.

227
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,375
You're turing into a good man.

228
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,917
That's enough. Let me go.

229
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,125
Here too.

230
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,000
It might hurt you if you keep moving.

231
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,500
All clean.

232
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,167
Embarrassed?

233
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,333
We have to clean inside too.

234
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,125
No... ah...

235
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,708
One is not enough?

236
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,333
It's standing up again.

237
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,917
You're gifted.

238
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,917
Try have a orgasm with back here.

239
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,750
No...

240
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,792
Here too?

241
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:07,917
Come on, a little bit more.

242
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,792
I... I...

243
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,083
See, you can do it.

244
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,458
You can take it out...

245
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,042
Now that we're in the bathroom,

246
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,542
get it all out.

247
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,208
It's done. Stop.

248
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,125
What? No, see it's coming.

249
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,333
It's coming.

250
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,167
What's coming?

251
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,875
See, refreshed, right?

252
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:46,125
Ecstacy acquired from being played,
nontop unconscious pleasure...

253
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,375
I... No... No...

254
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,417
I couldn't think at all.

255
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,708
I could only embrace everything
he did to my body.

256
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:59,083
Stop...

257
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,167
Want more?

258
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:08,458
Even so, my instinct told me to fight back.

259
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,292
Stop...

260
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:13,208
To reject as I am a man...

261
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,625
I was forced to bear this fear and ecstacy.

262
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,792
Struggle between life and death.

263
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,125
Why am I alive?

264
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,708
Why not let me die...

265
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,208
No, you have to eat it all.

266
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,250
You're awake, right?

267
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,833
Do it if you want to.

268
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,333
Taking life from the other,

269
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,750
or from yourself,

270
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,583
God is not going to stop you.

271
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,625
Do it.

272
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,583
Stop.

273
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,000
Why are you doing this?

274
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,792
Who knows?

275
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,083
Then why do you want to die?

276
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,000
Tell me.

277
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,125
I... have nothing...

278
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:48,083
It's all my fault... to loose everything.

279
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,667
It's not a reason.

280
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,208
What?

281
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,333
You think your death can bring them back?

282
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,875
What do you know!

283
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,583
I know everything.

284
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,333
What?

285
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,792
I'm the same.

286
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,333
What's that supposed to mean?

287
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,208
Drink it and you can die easily.

288
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,083
You decide.

289
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:13,333
How is he?

290
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,292
Visceral rupture by falling
when working at height.

291
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,042
It&s critical.

292
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,750
Operation room ready?

293
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,958
On the way.

294
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:42,375
Am I gonna die?

295
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,958
You want to live?

296
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:52,875
I have kids... I don't wanna die...

297
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,042
Then I'm not loosing you.

298
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,042
Let's get started.

299
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,458
-Yes. -Yes.

300
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,958
Suction.

301
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,667
On it.

302
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,042
Doctor.

303
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,250
It's ok. He's fighting.

304
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,833
It' ok.

305
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,417
It' ok...

306
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,083
It' ok...

307
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,250
-Defibrillator. -Here.

308
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,250
Damn.

309
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,125
Please.

310
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,125
Why?

311
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,792
Doctor.

312
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,500
Thank you so much.

313
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:52,417
I'm very sorry. I've done everything I could.

314
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,750
Why?

315
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,833
Why... do lives pass away?

316
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,333
You didn't drink it?

317
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,167
It's just normal water.

318
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,083
I thought you wanted to die.

319
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:54,250
You... it's you...

320
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:05,458
I... I what?

321
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,917
Don't laugh.

322
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:17,792
You're hard.

323
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:26,417
You were going to say that
I made your body this way?

324
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,583
It's your purpose!

325
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,583
Don't laugh!

326
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,250
It's what you did

327
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,417
making my body...

328
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,000
Yes.

329
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,208
S... Stop

330
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:06,417
Stop.

331
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:50,167
Feeling good? You're so hard.

332
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,042
You want it, don't you?

333
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,708
You don't want it? Then bite me.

334
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:41,292
Come on, come on, you hate me, don't you?

335
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,458
I can die for you.

336
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:48,167
Bite!

337
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:58,750
Hey, come on, do it!

338
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,375
It's twitching inside.

339
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,167
So hot, you're still alive...

340
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:11,917
You're living out the best of you...

341
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:16,583
So... so hot...

342
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,542
What are you laughing at...

343
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:46,458
I will talk to the Doctor.

344
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:47,375
Really?

345
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,458
Yes.

346
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:51,625
Thank you.

347
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,708
Excuse me.

348
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:56,958
Yes?

349
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,875
Can I help you?

350
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,708
No, sorry.

351
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,292
Okay.

352
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,500
You're here to jump again?

353
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,000
You...

354
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,750
You're free now.

355
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,417
You're so ruined

356
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,250
if I sue you for what you did.

357
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,292
You wish to ruin me?

358
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:50,875
Someone like you trying to
take his own life?

359
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:59,292
I didn't get your name.

360
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:06,458
That's right... I'm Ryuji Yoden. You?

361
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,458
I'm...

362
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:12,792
Makoto Katsuragi. I know.

363
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,042
This hospital...

364
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,250
You should remember,

365
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,958
This is where we first met.

366
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,125
Sorry.

367
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,500
They came in with no vital signs.

368
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,375
Don't hate me.

369
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:32,833
It's not anyone's fault, nor yours.

370
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:43,917
You hungry?

371
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,875
It's my treat. What do you want to eat?

372
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,375
Where do you want to go next?

373
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:24,917
Look ahead when driving.

374
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,333
Okay.

375
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,167
There can be an accident.

376
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:34,542
You're right.

377
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,625
I met you here before.

378
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,917
The secone coincidence.

379
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:44,167
All me...

380
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,458
You're not the only one
loosing important ones.

381
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:53,375
What?

382
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:01,833
So alike.

383
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:31,667
Sorry.

384
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,000
Go ahead, Doctor Genius.

385
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,708
Don't laugh at me.

386
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,292
I'm envying you.

387
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:43,708
I envy you can save lives.

388
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,167
Our work fights with death a lot.

389
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,125
And I have my way of doing it
as a emergency physician.

390
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,250
But he works in the hospice. To him,

391
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,625
there's even no chance to fight.

392
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:05,750
The unsavable lives had been eating him up.

393
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,458
I didn't notice his condition.

394
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,083
I thought you quit.

395
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,083
What?

396
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:45,750
Cigarette.

397
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,917
I forgot.

398
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:04,625
It's not your fault.

399
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah.

400
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:21,667
How about take some rest?

401
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,333
Yoden.

402
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:36,667
Can you come to my place tonight?

403
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,583
Fuck me, all you can.

404
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,333
It's rare to hear something like from you.

405
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,000
Weird?

406
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:52,833
Weird.

407
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,167
That's right.

408
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:00,583
Sorry, I'm on duty tonight.

409
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,292
Okay.

410
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:17,958
I'll go tomorrow.

411
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,375
You don't have to say that.

412
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,125
I want to.

413
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,792
The hospital was busy that night.

414
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:35,000
I saved three person from dying that night.

415
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,833
But,

416
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,542
I couldn't save the most important one.

417
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:29,667
All I felt was anger.

418
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:35,667
To him, and to myself.

419
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,708
This was his, fentanyl.

420
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:26,208
A pain killer hundred times powerful
than Morphine.

421
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,333
Strong poison.

422
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:38,000
I was looking a place to die with this.

423
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,125
Then,

424
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:48,500
I saw you, for the third time.

425
01:12:53,917 --> 01:12:57,333
Three coincidence. I told myself

426
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,417
I have to catch this guy.

427
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,583
I won't let go.

428
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:14,000
A guy so much like him
is to die in front of me.

429
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,625
I can't let it happen.

430
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:22,833
I have to bury the idea of being alive
into his head with the most humiliating way.

431
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,375
I want to implant the living instinct
into his mind.

432
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,833
This is a powerful drug to save lives.

433
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,167
Drug. That's how you want to do it?

434
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,958
You remember what you said to me
at the beginning?

435
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:45,875
What?

436
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:48,917
Freak.

437
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:54,875
Freak, that's it.

438
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,792
Willing to accept someone like me,
I take it you're one of us.

439
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,958
Stop it.

440
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:05,792
I'll stop.

441
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,000
Your life is no longer mine.

442
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,250
Do whatever you want.

443
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,708
How can you say that...

444
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:30,458
You will live no matter what.

445
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,292
I...

446
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:42,750
I can do whatever I want, right?

447
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,708
Give me your life.

448
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,083
What are you going to do to me?

449
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,208
What should I do?

450
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,917
Don't act as if you knew.

451
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:01,000
Ah... no.

452
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:07,875
You're about to?

453
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:31,833
You remember, right?

454
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:24,292
You can do whateve you want. It's all yours.

455
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,167
I'm not him.

456
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:43,333
I'm... Makoto Katsuragi.

457
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,375
Are you alive?

458
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,917
Alive.
