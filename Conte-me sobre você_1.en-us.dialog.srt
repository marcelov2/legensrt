1
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,595
...happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,474
Happy birthday to you.

3
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,603
Happy birthday, dear Chava.

4
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,773
-Blow them out!
-Ask for a wish, dear.

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,984
Blow out the candles!

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
-Oh!
-Bravo!

7
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,782
Blow harder!

8
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,201
There! That's it!

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,787
There, there.

10
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,871
That's cheating!

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,956
These evil candles,
they never blow out.

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,959
The candle blows out when
you're sure about your wish.

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,087
But you have to bite the cake first.

14
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,923
Right! Bite the cake, bite it!

15
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
No, no.

16
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,846
¡Bravo!

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,641
-No, sit down!
-Don't do it!

18
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,028
¡Wow!

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,786
Excellent.

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,081
-I hope this one wakes you up.
-Put that down.

21
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,211
Mom.

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,011
Hello.

23
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,888
What's up?

24
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,143
Right, as usual.

25
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,106
You always come up with some excuse.

26
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,777
Fine, then.

27
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,493
That creep will never change.

28
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,164
-Chava, he's your dad.
-That's how I know.

29
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,625
He either misses his flight
or crashes into a truck.

30
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,215
Maybe it's an aphrodisiac.

31
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:58,178
-I told you to leave it alone.
-What a temper!

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,599
I mean it when I say
you could use a girlfriend.

33
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:18,841
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

34
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,179
Did you like the present?

35
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,517
Hey.

36
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,935
Hi, Chava.

37
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,812
-How are you?
-Fine.

38
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,606
-What's this?
-It's our 4-month anniversary.

39
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,483
-Right, "shweetie"?
-"Yesh".

40
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,569
There you go again.
Quit showing off.

41
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,446
Why? You can have Chava.

42
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,865
Now that sexual diversity
is in style.

43
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,867
No, no way, dude, I respect all that,

44
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,954
but I'm totally into women.

45
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,206
-Oh, please!
-And I can prove it.

46
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,209
How can you prove it?
In that case let's do this.

47
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,878
This year you have to get a girlfriend.

48
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,131
Is that a challenge?

49
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,465
-Yes.
-You're on.

50
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,260
-What about you, Chava?
-You accept the challenge too?

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,178
Chava wants a girlfriend!

52
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,515
Chava wants a girlfriend!

53
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,725
Chava wants a girlfriend!

54
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,185
Okay, let's go to class.

55
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,441
This is the last topic that will be
on the test next week.

56
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,653
Remember it's an important
percentage of your final grade.

57
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,447
No, Mrs. Bertha.

58
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,783
Quiet! Who remembers the difference

59
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,078
between a function and an equation?

60
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,790
What have I told you
about those devices?

61
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,711
Put them away, please.
Everybody.

62
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,547
-Ramón?
-Mrs. Bertha,

63
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,092
I know the answer, but...

64
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,845
Ramón isn't inspired today.
HI HANDSOME :)

65
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,472
Hannah, please

66
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,059
Last class we learned that a function
can be expressed as an equation,

67
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,062
but not always vice-versa.
WHO ARE YOU?

68
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,689
Very good. Today we'll talk about...

69
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,443
YOUR SECRET ADMIRER.

70
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,196
polinominal functions.

71
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,911
Chava. Chava.

72
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,834
Next time I see your
cell phone, you won't get it back

73
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,921
until the end of the semester.
Is that clear?

74
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,756
Yes, Mrs. Bertha.

75
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,843
That goes for all of you.
Well, that's all for today.

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,805
Study up. Especially you, Ramón.

77
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,808
You know I love flunking you.
Remember that.

78
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,060
-Yes, teacher.
-Goodbye.

79
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,482
Hold on. Hey. Was it you guys?

80
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,943
Us? What are you talking about?

81
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,612
What the hell, Chava,
you were spacing out.

82
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,364
I'm fine. Later.

83
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,867
Move, asshole.

84
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,786
See you around, gorgeous.

85
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,322
GIVE ME A CLUE?

86
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,456
Come on, Chava. Glide.

87
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,420
Move, Chava. Keep going. Be consistent.

88
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,630
Let's go!

89
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,846
Where's your endurance?

90
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,307
Coach, give me a minute. I'm tired.

91
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,309
No. You have thirty seconds.

92
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,817
Very good, Carlos,
but don't slam the water.

93
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:09,322
Soft strokes, remember.
otherwise the water will hold you back.

94
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,616
Okay? Good.

95
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,706
Come on, Chava! Time's up.

96
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,516
Happy birthday.

97
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,855
Look at you, you're all grown up.

98
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,108
Sorry I couldn't be here.

99
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,778
There were issues at the site,
and work is a priority.

100
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,655
One day you'll understand.

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,658
Happy birthday.

102
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,415
Thanks.

103
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,628
Dinner's ready.

104
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,757
Bring the sauces please, Chava.

105
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,833
You still haven't fixed that faucet.

106
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,754
I'll fix it over the weekend.

107
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,632
Are you going to be here?

108
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,469
Well, if I'm not here

109
00:09:55,511 --> 00:10:00,141
you can fix it yourself,
you're old enough.

110
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,268
You haven't taught me how.

111
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,438
Nobody taught me, I learned by myself.

112
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,273
Finish your dinner.

113
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,778
I lost my appetite.

114
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:39,805
AT LEAST TELL ME YOUR NAME.

115
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:05,206
THEY CALL ME LITTLE WITCH.

116
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,798
LITTLE WITCH...

117
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,593
COME ON... TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

118
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,138
JUST ASK...

119
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,810
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

120
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,783
I knew you'd be here.

121
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,379
Your present.

122
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,549
OUR SONG
The toy car was a joke.

123
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,431
Remember I used to bring you here?

124
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,307
That's why I like coming.

125
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,896
We used to have picnics.

126
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,401
Cassette player, music,
we'd sing and dance.

127
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,905
I never understood

128
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,450
why you liked
coming here more than the park.

129
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,289
Back then everything was right, Dad.

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,958
You spent time at home.

131
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,002
Mom seemed happy.

132
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,338
Now I'm not so sure anymore.

133
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,513
The things you come up with.

134
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,811
Who were you texting?

135
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,319
-Some girlfriend, I suppose?
-No, no.

136
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,158
Busted, busted.

137
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,418
Let's go to class, dude!

138
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,130
-Why are you so concentrated?
-Give it back.

139
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,007
What's all this?

140
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,594
Damn you, Chava.
Why didn't you say anything?

141
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,638
I have no idea who she is, dude.

142
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,556
-Little Witch.
-Buddy,

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,975
he's going to win the bet, man.

144
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,145
Only if he finds out who it is.
Do you know?

145
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
Zilch. It's nobody.

146
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,493
You're fucking kidding me, Chavita!

147
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,619
What if it's her?

148
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,164
It can't be her.

149
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,833
You're just jealous.

150
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,502
Why not? He's tall and handsome.

151
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,965
Chavita. If it's her, you're gonna
totally win the bet. Look at her.

152
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,883
But how can we find out?

153
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,970
-Inviting her to the party Friday?
-Good idea.

154
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,056
Tell her to meet you at a certain time
and mystery solved.

155
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,017
That's good, "shweetie".

156
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,812
Go ahead and write to her: "Babe..."

157
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm not calling her Babe.

158
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,525
-What should we say?
-"What are you doing on Friday?"

159
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,610
We have that party, remember?

160
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,072
-Little Witch, Fran.
-Right!

161
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,159
"Hi, Little Witch... I have an idea.".

162
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,328
"What are you doing on Friday?"

163
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,001
-Why are you late, Chava?
-Sorry, Coach.

164
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,253
Let's do this, people!

165
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,715
Glide, come on.

166
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
Good!

167
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
Come on, Chava!

168
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,926
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER

169
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:34,516
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO A PARTY.

170
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,398
Let's see.

171
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,193
-What are you wearing?
-Hm.

172
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,330
Let's do this, folks!

173
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,918
The drinks are here.

174
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,922
-Ready?
-Ready.

175
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,674
This one's mine.

176
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,719
-Okay. Cheers, guys.
-Cheers!

177
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,722
Ah!

178
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,890
-Let's dance, "shweetie"?
-"Yesh".

179
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,440
So? Are you ready?

180
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm shitting myself.

181
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,985
Literally?

182
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,320
No, dude.
I mean I'm nervous, that's all.

183
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,323
It would be gross if you
were actually shitting yourself.

184
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,159
What time did you tell her?

185
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,204
At ten. I said I'd wait at the door.

186
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,873
-Shit, it's almost time!
-Right.

187
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,875
-One more shot?
-Let's down it.

188
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,169
-Here, Chavita.
-You were thirsty!

189
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,421
In a bad way, buddy.

190
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,007
I love this song. We have to dance.

191
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,342
-Come dance, Chava.
-I'll be right there.

192
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,920
Fran, Fran, Fran...!

193
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,984
Are you expecting someone?

194
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,986
Yes.

195
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,739
I'm Carlos.

196
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,661
We practice swimming together.

197
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,622
I'm Salvador.

198
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,084
-Chava, everyone calls me Chava.
-Yes, I know.

199
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,838
Marco, the coach,
is always yelling your name.

200
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,882
"Faster, Chava! You can do it, Chava!"

201
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,063
Well, good luck with that.

202
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:22,244
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT COMING.

203
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,112
What's up, Chava?

204
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,907
She didn't come.

205
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,583
Take it easy, you don't drink.

206
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,233
Chava, Chava.
Where are you going, dude?

207
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,902
Why didn't you come?

208
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,529
-Excuse me?
-We said we'd meet at ten.

209
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,615
You stood me up really bad.

210
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,535
Damn witch!

211
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,206
-You're the damn witch!
-What did you call me?

212
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,500
You know who you are,
stop fucking around.

213
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,876
I don't know what you mean.

214
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,753
My secret admirer?

215
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,937
Are you all right, Chava?
What happened, man?

216
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,524
-Let's go to the bathroom.
-Chava.

217
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,741
Are you all right, Chava?

218
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,952
It wasn't her.

219
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
I'm such an idiot!
You were right, Fran.

220
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,167
Yeah dude, but you didn't have to go
and make a fool of yourself.

221
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,670
You could have been more discreet.

222
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,797
Well, it's the truth.

223
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,968
Are you my friends?

224
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,221
I need to be by myself, please.

225
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,603
See you upstairs.

226
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,251
I'd never seen you like this.

227
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,255
I'm not drunk, Dad.

228
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,340
Right.

229
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,344
Look.

230
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,597
You left it last time.

231
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,644
I started singing...

232
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,898
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie

233
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,360
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry

234
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,571
Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye

235
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,616
Singing,
"This'll be the day that I die"

236
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,453
This will be the day that I die

237
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,376
Now for ten years
we've been on our own

238
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,629
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone

239
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,216
But that's not how it used to be

240
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,717
That's enough.

241
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,638
When the jester sang
for the King and Queen

242
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,350
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean

243
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:18,647
#And a voice
that came from you and me#

244
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,069
Oh and while the King
was looking down

245
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,529
The jester stole his...

246
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,572
Chava, Chava. That's enough.

247
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,034
Enough, hey.

248
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,287
No verdict was returned...

249
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:40,502
It seems your adolescent rebelliousness
came a little late, right?

250
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,258
No way.

251
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,813
Hand me the jack and the rod, please.

252
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
Jack and rod.

253
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,909
Perfect.

254
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,124
Shine the light here.

255
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,888
Bring the spare tire.

256
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,189
MESSAGE FROM LITTLE WITCH:

257
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,317
Are we eating together on Tuesday?
I love you.

258
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,837
Are we eating together on Tuesday?
I love you.

259
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,518
You look like you saw a ghost.

260
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,606
Don't tell me you're tired,
you didn't do anything.

261
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,615
Thanks. Let's go.

262
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,143
There goes the vomit guy!

263
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,364
The puker! What an asshole.

264
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,835
"You're the damn witch".

265
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,556
Chava.

266
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,018
Chava... Chava.

267
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,353
Time's up.

268
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,063
I need your test.

269
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,157
Damn Witch! You're the damn witch!

270
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,908
What did you call me?

271
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,290
My secret admirer?

272
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,341
Fucking shit.

273
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,014
Wanna ride?

274
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,349
No, thanks.

275
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,309
I don't bite, man.

276
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,313
-If you want to get wet, fine.
-All right!

277
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,900
Excuse the mess.

278
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,485
Don't worry about it.

279
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,529
Do you drive by the loop?

280
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,075
No, but I can change my route.

281
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,368
Sure?

282
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,121
So, how are you?

283
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,958
-Fine.
-No, I mean really.

284
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,046
I'm asking because
of the video and the memes.

285
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,756
I haven't seen any of it.

286
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,928
What's up with that?
You have a secret admirer?

287
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,973
Don't be like that.
I'm giving you a ride.

288
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,393
At least tell me the whole story.

289
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,354
-You're charging for the favor?
-Sure.

290
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,816
Everything in life has a price, Chava.

291
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,820
Relax, dude. I'm joking.

292
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,780
But I do want to know.

293
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,867
Tell you what, how about
you tell me everything over a beer?

294
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,292
Cool, isn't it?

295
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,187
That's my grandmother.
I live here with her.

296
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,231
You haven't changed.

297
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,025
I get that a lot.

298
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,822
Beer, or should I make
a cup a of tea

299
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,158
and show you my family photo albums?

300
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,077
Whatever you want.

301
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,998
Don't be an idiot.
I'll hand you a beer.

302
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,420
So you think your secret admirer

303
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
is your dad's lover?

304
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,009
How else would you explain he got
a message from her

305
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,802
agreeing to eat together?

306
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,267
I don't know.
Maybe it's a different Little Witch.

307
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
That's a hell of a coincidence.

308
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,939
Actually, it is very weird.

309
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,653
I'll help you, if you want.

310
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,990
How?

311
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,161
We can follow your dad
and catch him red-handed.

312
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:57,045
Om, shanti, shanti.

313
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:13,812
Shanti, shanti... shanti...

314
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,983
Since when do you meditate?

315
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,985
Your mom is teaching me.

316
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,822
-Join us.
-I have homework.

317
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,699
Maybe tomorrow then.

318
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,660
No, I can't tomorrow.

319
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,871
-Why not?
-I have a trip.

320
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,124
-Again?
-I have to supervise the construction.

321
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,376
You know how it is.

322
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,970
Shit, Chava.

323
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,013
-Let me see.
-You always get A.

324
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,976
The thing with your secret admirer
is getting out of control, dude.

325
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,270
-If you only knew.
-What?

326
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:00,108
Nothing. I mean,
it really is bothering me.

327
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,987
Speak of the devil.

328
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,577
Chava, don't make another scene.

329
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,287
What's he doing?

330
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,205
Mariana.

331
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,670
Sorry about the party.

332
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,047
I was wasted and someone
played a trick on me.

333
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,924
I stupidly thought it was you.

334
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,051
"I'm Chava, can I vomit on you?"

335
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,970
It's all right.

336
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,681
I freaked out when you puked.

337
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,271
I confess that I think the thing
about a secret admirer is sweet.

338
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,231
But no problem. Seriously.

339
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,943
Thanks.

340
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,029
Hey.

341
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:52,285
You should at least ask me out
for coffee so I will forgive you.

342
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,588
Are you kidding me?

343
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,882
Text me.

344
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,300
Yes.

345
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,056
What was that?

346
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,559
-No way, Mariana?
-Yes, dude.

347
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,606
No way! Mariana? Shit yeah.
What did you say to her?

348
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,697
What time are they meeting?

349
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,907
I don't know.

350
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,994
The message only said
they would eat together.

351
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,173
Did you know penguins choose
one single mate for their lifetime?

352
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,759
Really?

353
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,845
Do you have a girlfriend?

354
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,556
You're joking, aren't you?

355
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,808
I'm gay.

356
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,689
Gay, homosexual, queer.

357
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,692
What about you?

358
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,613
Me?

359
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,744
There he is.

360
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,825
I told you! That son of a bitch!

361
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,119
Calm down.

362
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,583
What's her number?

363
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,601
Hello? Hello?

364
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,610
-I have to go in.
-No, hang on.

365
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,529
We'll follow them when they come out.

366
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,791
So this is their little love den.

367
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,503
Sorry.

368
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,130
What a son of a bitch!

369
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,757
Hey, I apologized.

370
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,093
No, not you. Him.

371
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,722
Now I understand all those trips
and his bullshit lectures.

372
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,769
The point here is what's
the deal with that damn Little Witch?

373
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,647
She bewitched the dad,
what does she want with the son?

374
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,987
Let's go.

375
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,740
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

376
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,250
Chava.

377
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,085
What's going on with you?

378
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,800
Finals are coming up.

379
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,426
Don't fall short.

380
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,512
Yes, Mrs. Bertha.

381
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,648
I think he's gonna beat you.

382
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,696
Are you kidding, Hugo?
You're still betting?

383
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,668
Hey.

384
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,254
Do you have a moment
to talk about God?

385
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,382
Or to read a brochure,
or to buy a Bible?

386
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,800
Uh...

387
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,057
You seem worried.

388
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,100
If it's about sex before marriage,

389
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,644
I've been through that.

390
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,312
Here's our brochure.

391
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,564
-I'll read it later.
-Come to an assembly.

392
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,066
-The first one is free.
-No.

393
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,276
-It isn't free?
-No.

394
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,932
I said no, thank--

395
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,232
Chava?

396
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,652
What are you doing here?

397
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,612
Hello, Little Witch.

398
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,156
What the hell do you want?

399
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,451
You're fucking the dad
and hitting on the son too?

400
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,664
-You don't know what you're saying.
-I don't?

401
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,624
Álvaro? Sound familiar?

402
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,003
Álvaro...

403
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,048
...is my dad.

404
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,510
I'm your sister.

405
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,472
Vanessa.

406
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,475
What?

407
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,274
Uh, yes.

408
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,985
No.

409
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:01,130
CAN WE HANG OUT?

410
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,303
COME OVER.

411
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,518
That chick is fucking nuts.

412
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,064
Flirting with her half brother.

413
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,067
What about your dad?

414
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,446
He's the biggest son of a bitch.

415
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,391
No.

416
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,062
Carlos, don't get confused.
I'm not like you.

417
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,731
Like me?

418
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,360
I see.

419
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
Everything all right?

420
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:09,758
I'M SORRY, CHAVA.

421
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,085
I went over last night...

422
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,131
-I don't know where it is.
-We have Chemistry now.

423
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,220
I don't know where I put it.

424
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,013
Mariana?

425
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,432
Chava. Hi.

426
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,018
Do you have class?

427
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,394
Yes. Why?

428
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,357
I thought we could
go get something to drink.

429
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,775
Right now?

430
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,319
Why not?

431
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,905
Okay, let's go.

432
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,997
So? Who was your secret admirer?

433
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,964
Nobody. It was a joke my mentally
challenged friends played on me.

434
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,926
Can I tell you a secret?

435
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,471
I've been watching you for a while.

436
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,266
That's how I know you're different.

437
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,739
You have my number.

438
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,965
Boo!

439
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,634
What do you want?

440
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,970
I texted you and you didn't reply,

441
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,306
so my only option
was coming to see you.

442
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,103
Chava! Chava, let me explain please.

443
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,236
Coffee and a slice of pie, please.

444
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,155
Coffee and pie. For you?

445
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,615
The same.

446
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,951
-What kind of pie?
-Lime

447
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,746
Lime, good. Coming up.

448
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,088
You look so much like Dad.

449
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,178
I only found out recently.

450
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,307
I got angry, very angry,

451
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,519
and started investigating your family.

452
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,607
I got your number
and decided to approach you.

453
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,275
So I would tell you everything?

454
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,611
At first, yes.

455
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,948
I wanted to know more.
Where you lived, how you lived.

456
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,911
I always went to public schools.

457
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,163
I never had any luxuries.

458
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,626
I was envious.

459
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,961
Very envious.

460
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:40,636
But then I liked talking to you.

461
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,682
Deep down I always
wanted to have a brother.

462
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,940
Two pies.

463
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,109
Does your mom know?

464
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,361
No.

465
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,239
I guess she suspects.

466
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,534
Dad spends very little time with us.

467
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,956
One week with us and three weeks
away because he's working...

468
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,710
And it's always been that way.

469
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,131
What about... your mom?

470
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,591
No.

471
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,600
-Sorry.
-Wait, wait.

472
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,020
Will I see you again?

473
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,193
Bye.

474
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,200
Can I have milk, please?

475
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,577
Sure.

476
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,998
Chava. Chava, What the hell, dude?

477
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,292
I hardly see you anymore.

478
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,044
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine..

479
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,755
Let's go for some wings.

480
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,215
I can't. I have a swimming competition.

481
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,593
Well, good luck with that.

482
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,094
Some other time.

483
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,806
Hi. Hi, Chava.

484
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,057
Mariana.

485
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,061
These are Hannah, Hugo and Fran.

486
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:16,106
Nice meeting you.
May I steal him for a minute?

487
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,692
Sure. He's all yours.

488
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,698
What's up?
I thought you would write to me.

489
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,994
Yes, sorry.
I've got a lot on my mind,

490
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,830
but I promise to make it up to you.

491
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,292
-Friday?
-Okay.

492
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,712
-It's a fact, then?
-Yes, you have my word.

493
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,838
Okay.

494
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,011
No fucking way.

495
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,018
So it's a tie, Chava?

496
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,770
I don't think so. Not yet.

497
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,564
Who would have thought, Chavita?
You're a Casanova.

498
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,066
Stop it.

499
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,699
Okay, guys.
The first round will be duels.

500
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,867
One against the other.

501
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,662
The pair with the same number
are rivals.

502
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,001
Okay, who has number 1?

503
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,213
Okay. Who else?

504
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,633
Fine, first pair. Get in the water.

505
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,845
Let's go! Move it, people.

506
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,765
The rest of you continue warming up.
Let's go!

507
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,650
Ready...

508
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,120
Come on, come on!

509
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,558
Come on, come on!

510
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:28,113
Good, Carlos. Very good.

511
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,909
Well done, Carlos.
All right, next pair.

512
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,756
Number two.

513
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,559
Hey.

514
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,187
What's wrong?

515
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,189
No, nothing.

516
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:16,453
Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable
the other night. I didn't mean to.

517
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,288
See you tomorrow, Martínez!

518
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,732
Hey, I've been thinking.

519
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,822
I think you have to tell your mom.

520
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,827
Otherwise you would
become an accomplice.

521
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:45,959
Accomplices are just as guilty
as offenders, or something like that.

522
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,299
I think it would destroy my mom.

523
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,056
It will hurt more if she finds out
you knew and didn't tell her.

524
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,659
Why are you charging me
for the wings? We're buddies.

525
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,496
Hey. You're waiting for me?

526
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,539
Of course, we have to celebrate.

527
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,083
-But I lost.
-No.

528
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,960
You came in second place.
It wasn't that bad.

529
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,089
Dude, we ate all the wings.
You took too long.

530
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,549
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

531
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,884
Let's go.

532
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,054
-Chava the champ!
-I came in second.

533
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,769
-It's a Rubik cube, Fran.
-I've never solved it.

534
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,646
Who is it?

535
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,817
Hi.

536
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,611
I wasn't satisfied
with your answer yesterday,

537
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,780
so I took the liberty
of coming to see you.

538
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,620
By the way, I'm Vanessa.

539
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,998
Everybody calls me Little Witch
because I can see the future.

540
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,500
I actually saw Chava.

541
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,883
Take that expression off your faces,
it looks you saw a ghost.

542
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,267
-You want a ride?
-No. They're on the school bus.

543
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,271
I'll take you. Let's go.
We can all fit in my Beetle.

544
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,231
Let's go.

545
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,276
-Let's?
-Let's.

546
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,570
So, he showed up at my place

547
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:40,490
and it turns out that Chava and I
are... siblings.

548
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,783
Half.

549
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,744
Uh, half siblings.

550
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,416
Well, that's cool, isn't it?

551
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,880
I mean, finding out you have a sibling.

552
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,882
Isn't it?

553
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,553
-Well, let's go.
-Let's.

554
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,056
You know what?

555
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,393
That's okay,
we'll go on the school bus.

556
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,270
I can take you, seriously.

557
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,689
It's fine, don't worry about it.
Thanks.

558
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,442
Don't say anything,
I'll tell you about it later.

559
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,403
-Fine.
-Yeah, no problem.

560
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,782
Well, it was a pleasure
meeting you, Little Witch.

561
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,284
You too.

562
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,786
-Anything you need, huh?
-Thanks.

563
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,413
Love your hair.

564
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,416
Fran?

565
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,044
Fra-Fran, right. F-r-a-n.

566
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,587
-Fran.
-Fran.

567
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,505
Yeah, cool.

568
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,926
-Bye.
-Bye.

569
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,473
Bye.

570
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,434
-Your carriage, sir.
-What was that all about?

571
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,270
-What?
-You can't just show up and act

572
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,314
like we're one big, happy family.

573
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,608
I don't know you,

574
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,777
and you don't know me.

575
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,404
Give me some space.

576
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,797
Everything all right?

577
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,466
Wanna join me?

578
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,261
No, I don't like it.

579
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,682
You should try

580
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,768
just to spend more time
with your mother.

581
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,939
Mom, are you happy?

582
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,401
Sure. Can't you tell?

583
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,403
No, it's a serious question.

584
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,489
Are you happy with Dad?

585
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,577
I already said yes.

586
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,669
Dad has another family.

587
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,767
Chava...

588
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,146
Mom, I'm serious. I saw him.

589
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,190
I don't want to talk about it, Chava.

590
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,152
Respect that.

591
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,157
I made my decision a long time ago.

592
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,077
Now you can make your own.

593
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,076
Dad?

594
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,794
I thought you were on a trip.

595
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,092
Chava.

596
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,847
Yes, but I just got back today.

597
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:39,813
I'm here helping a friend.

598
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,816
He has a problem.

599
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,611
He lives here.

600
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,747
What are you doing around here?

601
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,459
Same thing. Going to a friend's house.

602
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:08,716
I'd give you a ride but
I don't know how long this will take.

603
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,594
That's okay, I'll wait for you.

604
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:15,056
That way I can meet your friends.
You haven't introduced us.

605
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,353
Álvaro! Is the bread here?

606
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,275
Hi.

607
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,487
Who is this kid?

608
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,326
I'm Salvador. His son.

609
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,622
Is dinner ready?

610
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,129
No.

611
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,300
It wasn't supposed
to be like this, Chava.

612
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,219
You did the same thing to me.

613
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,062
Go away. Just go.

614
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,399
I knew it, I knew it.

615
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,276
Dad?

616
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,072
-Dad?
-Go.

617
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,116
I'll explain it to you later.

618
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,619
Please don't say anything
to your mother.

619
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:28,189
I FUCKED UP

620
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,941
WHAT HAPPENED?

621
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:38,616
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

622
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,952
LET'S GO AWAY! PACK A SMALL BAG.

623
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:45,123
MEET ME TOMORROW AT THE GATE...

624
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,987
Aren't you telling me
where we're going?

625
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,742
You're so impatient.
You're like a little boy, dude.

626
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:25,288
-To a wedding.
-On a Friday?

627
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,916
Maybe it was cheaper.

628
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,442
-We have to change.
-What?

629
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,287
Try this on.

630
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,790
-Here?
-Yeah.

631
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,920
Wow.

632
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,348
Charlie.

633
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,849
Congratulations.

634
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,393
I'm glad you made it.

635
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,938
Chava! what a surprise.

636
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,149
Bruno, honey, come.
These are my students.

637
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,819
-Chava and Charlie.
-Hi, it's a pleasure.

638
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,195
I'm so glad you came.

639
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:42,365
Marco, Bruno.
Sorry for interrupting, we're all set.

640
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,784
-Come please?
-Yes.

641
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,161
See you later, you two hurry up.

642
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,666
-Wow.
-What the hell, why didn't you tell me?

643
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,460
I said we were going
to a friend's wedding. I didn't lie.

644
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,421
-No, but it's our coach.
-Mhm.

645
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,215
-and it's a gay wedding.
-What's the big deal?

646
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,053
Come on.

647
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,496
MISSED MESSAGES

648
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,459
-Oh! Let's dance, come on.
-I'll be right there.

649
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,335
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

650
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:40,006
-Promise.
-Okay, see you later.

651
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,073
-No.
-Come dance.

652
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,850
Hey.

653
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,438
Are you all right?

654
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:45,775
I'm not sure.

655
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,156
-Because of what happened?
-No.

656
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,453
Well, yeah. Sort of.

657
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,167
I don't know.
Everything suddenly changed.

658
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,796
I have a half sister,

659
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,548
I don't know my dad anymore,

660
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,718
and worst of all, I don't know myself.

661
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:19,058
Discovery.
That's what life is all about, Chava.

662
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,354
Sometimes it's for the best,
sometimes it's not.

663
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,566
This is only the beginning.

664
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:36,575
It's not that I'm emotional
over another sunrise,

665
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:41,372
but it's the first one
that you spend with me.

666
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:44,208
I don't want to see

667
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,252
the sunrise by myself ever again.

668
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:51,674
Alone it has no flair or pleasure.

669
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,843
One, two, three!

670
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,262
When you set your eyes on me

671
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,597
I experience adventures
without going anywhere.

672
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,100
I can't stop laughing
when I look at you

673
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,602
because I know
it was your kiss that I saw.

674
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,771
Ask me for whatever you want,
I'll say yes.

675
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,190
Ask me for nonsense,
but never,

676
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,359
never go away

677
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,154
I have a right to be happy.

678
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,406
Never go far.

679
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,034
If you go
it would be too much for me.

680
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,286
Where are you going?
Will you be back?

681
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,705
Say you'll take me too

682
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,749
Love me, kiss me.

683
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,627
Leave your trace on me at dawn...

684
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,193
-No.
-It was this one.

685
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,994
You're going to laugh,

686
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,538
but I've never changed a tire.

687
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:12,338
We need a jack...

688
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,381
and a lug "knot".

689
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,595
-You have no idea, do you?
-I don't.

690
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,305
Let's look it up.

691
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,266
Thank God for the 21st century.

692
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,410
Fucking shit, dude.

693
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,454
One of the coaches
married his boyfriend.

694
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:31,333
-No way, he's a faggot?
-Sure, didn't you know?

695
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,210
You can tell he's a fairy.

696
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:37,047
That's true.
He's always hanging out with Carlos.

697
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,550
They say queers stick together.

698
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,886
-Those faggots.
-Fucking gross.

699
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,096
I know, it's disgusting.

700
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,236
Chava.

701
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,198
You owe us an explanation, dude.

702
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,908
I know.

703
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,243
We've been your friends
for a helluva long time.

704
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,204
That's what friends are for,

705
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,581
-to lean on.
-What the hell?

706
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,334
What the hell, Chava? You stood me up.

707
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,045
If you think I'm going to chase you,
you're fucking stupid.

708
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,924
Chava.

709
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,968
You wanna watch a movie
or something? What's wrong?

710
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,638
Chava, tell us what's going on.

711
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,431
-What's the matter?
-You changed.

712
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,016
That's enough!

713
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,313
You guys say you're my friends
but I can never speak

714
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,274
to one of you privately.
You're like a combo.

715
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:41,362
And you Fran,
you're always screwing with me.

716
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:45,282
It seems all you care about
is the damn bet.

717
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,660
How fucking selfish.

718
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,499
And you? What do you want?

719
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,335
You take me to a gay wedding

720
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,630
and then you expect us to paint
the world in rainbow colors?

721
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,757
Or organize a gay pride parade?

722
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,136
No, Carlos. I'm not like you.

723
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,098
I'm not a faggot!

724
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,437
You're an asshole!

725
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,360
You really are an ass, Chava.

726
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:32,890
#I'M NOT A FAGGOT

727
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,437
Hi there.

728
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,980
How's school?

729
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,192
Fine.

730
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,736
How's your sweetheart?

731
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,823
What?

732
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,158
Why haven't you told me?

733
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,662
The other day I caught him
texting his girlfriend.

734
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,918
I'm gay.

735
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,339
No way, you're not gay.

736
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,844
Yes. Gay.

737
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:55,055
Homosexual, queer...

738
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,433
-Don't joke about this.
-I'm not joking, Mom.

739
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,017
Didn't you hear me?

740
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,314
-I'm gay.
-No, son. You're not gay.

741
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:08,902
You're confused.
Are you just saying it for revenge...?

742
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,279
Revenge for what, Dad?

743
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,700
I don't-- I don't know.
For what happened on your birthday.

744
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,702
You're not that way.

745
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,374
Gay people suffer a lot.

746
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:27,838
They're beaten,
discriminated, and rejected.

747
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,300
You don't want that for yourself.

748
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,343
It's not that I want it,

749
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,679
it's the way I am.

750
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,265
What do you prefer?

751
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,143
For me to live my life pretending
I'm something I'm not?

752
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,936
A person I'm not?

753
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,439
No, Dad.

754
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,399
You and I are different that way.

755
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,779
You didn't catch me
texting a girlfriend.

756
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,116
It was your daughter trying
to make sense of your double life.

757
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,162
No, no, Mom, don't cry.

758
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,789
You knew and decided to keep quiet.

759
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,420
You told me to make my own decision.

760
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,631
Today I'm deciding to stop this farce.

761
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:32,462
What do you want?

762
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,132
Can we talk?

763
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,013
Come in, it's open.

764
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,904
I'm sorry.

765
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,160
I didn't mean to say all that.

766
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,121
I know I screwed up.

767
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,674
I told my parents.

768
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,594
What?

769
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,680
That you are indeed like me?

770
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,808
That you are indeed a faggot?

771
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,815
I'm glad you finally accepted it.

772
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,113
One day you offend me in front
of your friends,

773
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,492
and then you want the world
to be rainbow colored.

774
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:48,121
No, Chava.
That's not the way it works.

775
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,960
I like you... I like you a lot.

776
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,465
But you're in a different place.

777
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:01,510
You're barely discovering yourself,

778
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,845
accepting yourself,

779
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,222
and that's fine.

780
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,559
But I've been through that

781
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,813
and I know what it means.

782
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:19,486
If one day you
need a shoulder to cry on

783
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,947
or someone to talk to,

784
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,200
I'll be here.

785
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,620
But only as a friend.

786
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:34,584
Because it's not easy, Chava.
Not easy at all.

787
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:06,950
Goodbye.

788
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,130
I will be quiet for a few days

789
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:23,842
I'll stay away from your name
and from my artillery

790
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:28,513
I'll embrace the horizon
and I will forget

791
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:32,517
I will learn to forget

792
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:07,177
If he truly loves you
let him sing for you

793
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:11,139
And if he couldn't love you
let him cry for you

794
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,976
May someone steal your heart away
without a warning,

795
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:18,939
To make you understand
of miracles and of the sea

796
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,857
I will be quiet for a few days,

797
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,569
I'll stay away from your name
and from my artillery

798
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:28,448
I'll embrace the horizon
and I will forget

799
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,203
I will learn to forget

800
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,235
PLEASE COME.

801
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:11,032
I'M ON THE ROOFTOP
OF 32 ARCHIMEDES AVE.

802
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:17,789
I will learn to forget

803
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,194
Everything's gone to shit.

804
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,574
I can't go home,

805
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,618
my friends hate me,

806
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,246
and the dude I like
told me to go to hell.

807
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,456
It was all my fault.

808
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,296
I confronted Dad.

809
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:10,467
He isn't with us anymore.

810
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:14,137
Sorry.

811
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,433
I was out of control, I was furious.

812
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,565
Maybe things happen for a reason.

813
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,818
I never had the balls
to tell the truth.

814
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:33,531
Instead of that, I acted like a child
and made up this stupid

815
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,328
secret admirer diversion.
And we know how that went.

816
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,249
Maybe things happen for a reason.

817
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,315
Good morning.

818
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:12,195
Sorry, it's getting late.

819
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:13,863
But relax.

820
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,408
Don't rush.

821
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:50,817
Did you know penguins choose
one single mate for their lifetime?

822
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,361
No.

823
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,781
I didn't know that,
"Mister Discovery Channel".

824
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,411
Take it.

825
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:05,165
-Really?
-Sure.

826
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,084
A gift from your half sister.

827
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,628
Thanks.

828
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,673
Thanks for everything.

829
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:17,594
I'm here for you.

830
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,807
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

831
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:33,359
Looking good, Hannah!

832
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,116
Apologize to her, jerk.

833
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,451
Or else?

834
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:44,162
You'll vomit on me, faggot?

835
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,915
-If I have to.
-"If I have to".

836
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,793
What happened?

837
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:53,588
What happened? Hannah won't tell me.
Cha-Chava.

838
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,590
I told you to apologize to her.

839
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:58,968
I'm not going to, queer.

840
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:07,811
Chava...

841
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,856
Chava.

842
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,109
Chava.

843
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:17,654
Chava.

844
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,413
Chava.

845
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,667
Thanks.

846
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,505
That's what friends are for.

847
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:40,969
Sorry.

848
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:45,306
For what I said.

849
01:25:45,348 --> 01:25:48,309
-For being distant, for what I did.
-It's okay.

850
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:53,189
Really, we all have
our bad moments, okay?

851
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:55,108
That jerk is getting expelled.

852
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:59,445
You're so brave, man.

853
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,115
Get over here, Chava.

854
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,644
SORRY AGAIN!

855
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:07,639
32 ARCHIMEDES AVE.
TONIGHT AT 7 P.M.

856
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,607
Chava.

857
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:20,235
Come.

858
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:54,060
Why, Mom?

859
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:57,981
Why didn't you ever say anything?

860
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,400
For you.

861
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,736
-Oh.
-I didn't want to put you through this.

862
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:07,448
-Don't use me as an excuse.
-No, Chava, it isn't an excuse.

863
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:08,825
It's the truth.

864
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,036
But here I am now...

865
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:18,001
...facing you

866
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,674
and asking you to forgive me.

867
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:18,061
I thought you wouldn't come.

868
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,607
Here I am.

869
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,379
Now what?

870
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,262
I don't know, Dad.

871
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,768
I don't know you.

872
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,313
I don't know who you are.

873
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:06,901
Please...

874
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:09,987
...tell me about yourself.

875
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,915
It seems Chavita won the bet
one to zero.

876
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:05,460
No. Not yet, Fran.

877
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,367
FOR MY FATHER...

878
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:23,496
WHO LEFT BEFORE HE WAS ABLE
TO TELL ME ABOUT HIMSELF
