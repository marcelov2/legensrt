1
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,204
Why did you stop?

2
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,280
Come on!

3
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
Huh?

4
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,476
If that's all you can do

5
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,886
don't bother next time

6
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,475
I'll go find someone else

7
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,306
You got it?

8
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,232
Almost done

9
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,759
James!

10
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:38,527
James!

11
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,044
James! You motherfucker!

12
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,139
Bitch, where are you?

13
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
Fucking hell!

14
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,164
Where's James?

15
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,415
I said where the fuck is James?

16
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,593
Can't you hear it?

17
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:51,963
Almost done. Bitch!

18
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,960
I let you two fuck with our clients,

19
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:57,691
not with each other.

20
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,560
I said stop!

21
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:01,507
Fuck off!

22
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,160
Are you dogs, fuckers?

23
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

24
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Bitch!

25
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:18,415
You wanna die, whore?

26
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,447
You're the whore!

27
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,800
You took my shit, didn't you?

28
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,022
What shit?

29
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,725
I can't hold it anymore.

30
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,360
I said stop! Motherfucker!

31
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,092
Fuck you! Bitch!

32
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,697
I couldn't finish my drug cost last time
because of you.

33
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
Did you tell James to take my shit?

34
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,327
What shit are you talking about?

35
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,380
Don't fucking lie.
Are you high on diet pills?

36
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,080
Don't fucking lie.

37
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,686
What fucking lie!

38
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
If you got a problem, sort it out with him.

39
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,200
You do it, sell it by yourselves.

40
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,455
What's it got to do with me?

41
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,481
It fucking does!

42
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,575
It passed you guys those drugs here.

43
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
So it fucking does!

44
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:15,827
You fucking get out now!

45
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,819
No!

46
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,791
Why the fuck are you still here?

47
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,100
I said get out!

48
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,639
You and I gotta talk!

49
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,506
If not, no client today!

50
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,498
Bitch! I'm working!

51
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,043
You mind your own shit!

52
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:45,108
You're working with my guy!

53
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Your guy? Did you sign a contract?

54
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,991
You wanna take this to the Big Boss?

55
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,271
Do you?

56
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,191
Are you making Big boss threatening me?

57
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,471
Not just threatening,
but I fucking mean it!

58
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:12,385
Or you wanna fight with me?

59
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,876
Who the fuck wanna fight (fuck) you?

60
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,047
With lips so red like dog's period.

61
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,047
Ever looked at yourself in the mirror?

62
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,262
You put your mom's period on your lips?

63
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:53,061
Come on!

64
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:54,604
Come on!

65
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,975
I'm fucking coming!

66
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Why did you stop?

67
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,119
Why did you stop?

68
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:16,463
Why the fuck did you stop!

69
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,033
Hit me.

70
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:26,427
Come on! Hit me!

71
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,416
Are you sure?

72
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,067
You brought this on yourself.

73
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,429
Shit!

74
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Damn!

75
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
Fucking hell!

76
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
Fucking hell!

77
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,760
Come on!

78
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,430
Come on!

79
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,411
Enough!

80
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,430
I said enough!

81
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:36,469
Let go of me!

82
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:38,094
I said stop! You bitch!

83
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,464
Are you gonna stop?

84
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,488
No!

85
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,680
Are you gonna shoot me?

86
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:53,549
Cuz you won't stop.

87
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,611
You side with him.

88
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:02,413
And blame it on me.

89
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,280
Tell her.

90
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,002
About what we discussed.

91
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,330
Shut up!

92
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:14,736
Tell her! Tell her now!

93
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,228
You're gonna shut up?

94
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,408
You have no guts?

95
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,520
Want me to tell her?

96
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,480
Will you shut up, motherfucker?

97
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,916
Spit it out!

98
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:32,869
Don't push me.

99
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,728
Don't fucking push me.

100
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,480
What do you want?

101
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,321
You want me to take the blame?

102
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,001
Do you?

103
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,073
I gotta take this to the Big Boss.

104
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,183
And if you two aren't guilty,

105
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,386
then someone must be punished.

106
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,440
You bitch!

107
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,062
Stand up!

108
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,481
Smile

109
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:25,486
Smile... Smile

110
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,208
Smile!

111
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,230
Come here!

112
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,628
I said come here!

113
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,283
Strip.

114
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:58,351
Strip!

115
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,920
Prick!

116
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,534
Who told you to put it on?

117
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,487
Who told you to put it on?

118
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,003
Who told you to put it on?

119
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,227
Come on!

120
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
What the fuck is wrong with you?

121
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,240
I'm the one who should ask you,
not the other way around.

122
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,279
What do you want from me?

123
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:27,367
What would I get from someone like you?

124
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:33,371
Why are you trying to
make her misunderstand me?

125
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,234
You got a brain. Go figure.

126
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,920
About what you asked me last night,

127
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,412
were you being serious or just kidding?

128
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,332
Bitch!

129
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
How is it?

130
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,760
Who are you talking about?

131
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:13,215
Not you.

132
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,960
I had to do it.

133
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:29,192
You had to do it, or you want to do it?

134
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,449
Of course I had to.

135
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,840
Unless you want this to end with you.

136
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,488
Do you know what I'm thinking right now?

137
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,440
Do you want to have it more?

138
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,400
Wait here. I'll be right back.

139
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,082
How many cuts?

140
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,383
A lot.

141
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,276
Smartass!

142
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:29,527
Then what should I answer?

143
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,324
Go get it done!

144
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,463
What the fuck are you looking at? Go!

145
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,640
That's enough.

146
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:50,848
Enough!

147
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,379
What's the matter?

148
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,309
You see we're having problems.

149
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,184
Let's do it next time.

150
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,320
What the fuck is wrong?

151
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,377
Jealous?

152
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,386
I have the right to be?

153
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:43,213
Nobody has the right to
feel anything for anybody.

154
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,528
We're just taking our responsibilities.
That's it.

155
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:05,368
Whore!

156
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,564
You can go now.

157
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,795
I might have clients in the afternoon.

158
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:38,994
Where are you going?

159
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,374
Get some food.

160
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,685
Shit!

161
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,040
Ouch! What the fuck is wrong with you?

162
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,802
What the fuck do you want?

163
00:46:56,372 --> 00:46:58,384
Why don't you sit with me?

164
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,071
I'm sitting with you now.

165
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:47,380
Bored?

166
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,372
Of you?

167
00:48:04,372 --> 00:48:06,375
Of yourself.

168
00:48:19,883 --> 00:48:21,389
You know something?

169
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,388
If not for Big Boss,

170
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:28,478
I'll still be washing
the dishes over there.

171
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,387
Where?

172
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:37,568
I asked him if I could be
a child seat drink.

173
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,025
He wouldn't let me.

174
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:48,369
You wanna be a whore?

175
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,268
You think I'm pretty?

176
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,181
I think you've made the right choice.

177
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:20,370
It's me who still hasn't gone anywhere.

178
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,386
Try ignoring your personal feelings.

179
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:40,374
I am bewildered.

180
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,890
Don't let it take over you.

181
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,492
How was last night?

182
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,541
Mac didn't use it.

183
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,387
But he saw me doing it. Fucking crazy.

184
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,840
So what?

185
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,536
He helps us make money.

186
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,655
And another thing is
we're working as a team.

187
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
Actually, what do you want to tell me?

188
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,520
Don't imagine what hasn't really happened.

189
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:57,672
And don't put your thoughts
into someone else's.

190
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,480
You still love him, don't you.

191
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,554
Are you asking me?

192
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:19,413
Or just questioning yourself?

193
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,199
I don't know what you said.

194
00:51:29,224 --> 00:51:30,581
But what I know is,

195
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:33,415
You always try to pick on him.

196
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,760
For what?

197
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:48,388
This kind of job has
taught me to fool others.

198
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,440
But you've gone further than I have.

199
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:55,006
Because you've fooled yourself.

200
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Don't try to drag me into your world.

201
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:14,380
If you don't have me,

202
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:17,227
Your life will be more difficult.

203
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,560
I'm feeling like trying.

204
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:35,569
You have the guts?

205
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:40,168
Wanna see me try?

206
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:05,392
Sit down.

207
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,000
I said sit down.

208
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,800
Sit down!

209
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:35,368
Sit, prick!

210
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,207
I let you use this gun only when necessary.

211
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:50,160
You must use it only when you have to.

212
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,975
Otherwise, never bring it out.

213
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,280
And never point it at my face again.

214
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:45,998
Ever thought about
how you would live without me?

215
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:51,389
And you've ever thought
how you would live without me?

216
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:46,378
Better get going.

217
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:48,419
We have lots to do.

218
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,219
What the fuck are you looking at?

219
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,568
Move!

220
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,373
I said move!

221
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,389
Fucking hell!

222
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,082
What the fuck are you looking at?

223
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:25,326
<i>You're bitch, did I kill your dad?</i>

224
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,650
<i>You're bitch, did I kill your dad?</i>

225
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,520
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

226
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,888
<i>You're bitch, did I kill your dad?</i>

227
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,288
<i>You're bitch, did I kill your dad?</i>

228
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,949
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

229
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,272
<i>You're bitch, did I kill your dad?</i>

230
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,078
<i>Holy shit!</i>

231
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,256
You're here by yourself?

232
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:06,369
Yes

233
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,499
How long have you been here?

234
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,482
A while

235
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:15,661
How about you?

236
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:18,283
Just got here.

237
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,680
Where are you from?

238
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:29,371
Far.

239
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,080
In the city.

240
01:05:33,403 --> 01:05:34,923
Have you eaten anything?

241
01:05:37,711 --> 01:05:39,231
You're gonna treat me?

242
01:05:42,729 --> 01:05:44,232
I can.

243
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:48,240
Anything to eat around here?

244
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,320
Yes.

245
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,145
Candy.

246
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,960
Toys.

247
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,481
Everything.

248
01:05:59,192 --> 01:06:00,755
Wanna try?

249
01:06:01,982 --> 01:06:03,822
Interesting.

250
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,920
What are you looking for?

251
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,560
Someone.

252
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,389
Who?

253
01:06:38,406 --> 01:06:40,366
Do you know Mac?

254
01:06:43,469 --> 01:06:44,989
Of course.

255
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,269
Why did you ask?

256
01:06:47,682 --> 01:06:49,179
Wanna see him?

257
01:06:51,335 --> 01:06:52,418
No.

258
01:06:52,443 --> 01:06:54,123
I'm here to see the other guy.

259
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,200
Mac is around here, right?

260
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,560
This place is kinda strange.

261
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,160
Dark alleys.

262
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,793
But when you come upstairs,

263
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,080
There's an outdoor space.

264
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:26,592
Bright.

265
01:07:28,831 --> 01:07:31,322
Ever get scared?

266
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:37,495
Who exactly are you here to see?

267
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:42,608
You haven't told me
if you're scared or not.

268
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,382
You want me to scared of what?

269
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:55,556
What are you usually scared of?

270
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,680
You're PlayBoy, right?

271
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,399
Why do you know my name?

272
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,101
You're famous, aren't you?

273
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,183
Not many people know me.

274
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:50,541
Why not?

275
01:08:57,572 --> 01:09:00,131
I'm not that important.

276
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,589
Why would they want to know me?

277
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:08,194
Or perhaps you don't allow them
to get to know you.

278
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,680
I want to know only who I want to know.

279
01:09:20,554 --> 01:09:22,756
For those I don't want to know,

280
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:29,288
I only see them as strangers.

281
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:38,185
Why do you like having sex with strangers?

282
01:09:41,837 --> 01:09:45,557
Maybe because I don't want to know them.

283
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:53,168
You're handsome.

284
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,272
Aren't you boyfriend jealous?

285
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:03,019
Would anyone with a boyfriend
stay in this kind of place?

286
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,349
How about you? Where's your boyfriend?

287
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:11,827
Why would you want to know?

288
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:16,681
Good point.

289
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,414
Why would I want to know?

290
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:30,095
It's amazing that

291
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,000
there're people who would
come all the way here.

292
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,161
There's just one type of people
who would come here.

293
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:48,462
Who?

294
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:54,434
Strangers.

295
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:14,168
Actually,

296
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:17,185
No one wants to come around here.

297
01:11:18,471 --> 01:11:19,911
How come?

298
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:24,416
Dirty I guess.

299
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:27,477
Only dust.

300
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:32,751
There's no rain for ages.

301
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:37,295
Hot

302
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,400
And you like it?

303
01:11:46,674 --> 01:11:48,179
Yeah, kind of.

304
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,359
I like sunlight,

305
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,102
open space.

306
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,059
I like it when people see me,

307
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,171
The way I see them.

308
01:12:14,812 --> 01:12:16,011
How about you?

309
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:19,346
Ever had the same feelings?

310
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:24,429
Yeah.

311
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:27,504
But I feel everything

312
01:12:29,364 --> 01:12:31,477
In the opposite way.

313
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,252
You already know what you have to do?

314
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,427
Where're the toys?

315
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,095
Keep this way.

316
01:14:53,676 --> 01:14:56,171
When you see the construtec zone,
then turn left.

317
01:14:57,982 --> 01:14:59,187
And you will find.

318
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,221
Your toy is waiting for you
on the top of the building.

319
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,200
Ought to go with you?

320
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:22,453
Special services?

321
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:27,828
No, it's not. Just my responsibility.

322
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,189
Sound like I'm being enforced.

323
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:38,183
So, I will see you in two hours.

324
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,349
Make it extreme! Just do not lost your way.

325
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,760
So, what are you gonna do with that Boy?

326
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,520
What are you doing?

327
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,720
You're making me worried.

328
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,170
This place is dark

329
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,169
and dirty.

330
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,827
Not suitable for someone like you.

331
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:03,195
Let's find something to do outside.

332
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:07,467
But it's more interesting in here.

333
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:12,178
But I don't want to do it here.

334
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,280
Why not? Afraid?

335
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:23,514
I'm the one who should ask you.

336
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,375
I had to do it.

337
01:26:28,626 --> 01:26:30,133
You have to help me.

338
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:43,175
OK?

339
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,760
I'm asking you, "Are you ok?"

340
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,360
Do I have to kill them?

341
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:30,401
Why do you have to waste your time?

342
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,456
Let them kill each other.

343
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:44,326
Are you sure about this?

344
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:49,883
Some cases are not in our role.

345
01:28:51,085 --> 01:28:54,165
We only have a duty to
keep the eyes on them.

346
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:09,582
Perhaps, The Gang of Cherry wouldn't
suit for here anymore. Agree?

347
01:29:16,846 --> 01:29:18,488
It's a very sunny day.

348
01:29:25,253 --> 01:29:26,699
Do you like it?

349
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,455
<i>She walks through this way alone.</i>

350
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,171
<i>It is reflectively desolated.</i>

351
01:30:18,196 --> 01:30:20,680
<i>Follow her, keep follow her.</i>

352
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:22,692
<i>What a beating heart!</i>

353
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,485
<i>She is wearing slutty appearance.</i>

354
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,815
<i>That's making me horny.</i>

355
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,680
<i>Follow her without missing sight.</i>

356
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,688
<i>Want to fuck her.</i>

357
01:30:32,688 --> 01:30:37,686
<i>Restrain myself, Restrain myself...</i>

358
01:30:37,686 --> 01:30:40,696
<i>I can't stand. I can't stand...</i>

359
01:30:42,695 --> 01:30:45,686
<i>Restrain myself, Restrain myself...</i>

360
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,591
<i>I can't stand. I can't stand...</i>

361
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:55,312
<i>This shall be raping.</i>

362
01:30:55,337 --> 01:30:57,455
<i>You shall be raped.</i>

363
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,117
<i>Seeing you makes me want to rape.</i>

364
01:31:00,142 --> 01:31:02,531
<i>You deserve to be raped.</i>

365
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,566
<i>This shall be raping.</i>

366
01:31:04,691 --> 01:31:07,594
<i>You shall be raped.</i>

367
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,695
<i>Seeing you makes me want to rape.</i>

368
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,209
<i>You deserve to be raped.</i>

369
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:54,685
Fucked up!

370
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,720
The body is gone.

371
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,560
Besides that motherfucker,
anyone else went into the building?

372
01:32:08,794 --> 01:32:10,298
No.

373
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,823
You go take care of the other body,

374
01:32:17,142 --> 01:32:18,782
So we don't waste our time.

375
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:26,447
Take this. In case you need it.

376
01:32:27,807 --> 01:32:29,314
For what?

377
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:35,392
So you can trust me.

378
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,269
What about you?

379
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,438
I'll take care of the other body.

380
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,640
No.

381
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,065
You gotta go back to the building.

382
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,135
What the fuck are you waiting for?

383
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,170
Shoot!

384
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,613
Shoot!

385
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,032
You take one. I take one.

386
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,943
Let it out,

387
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,818
So we can go away together.

388
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,366
Because you're like this,

389
01:35:57,115 --> 01:35:58,820
You have to live in pain.

390
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,856
Shoot!

391
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,154
Who's going away with you?

392
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:38,945
Have I said that?

393
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,560
When did I say that?

394
01:36:50,339 --> 01:36:52,339
You don't have the guts to shoot me.

395
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,615
How do you know?

396
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,292
Because it's too hard for you.

397
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,720
You and I no longer owe each other.

398
01:37:34,207 --> 01:37:38,327
And you two can sort it out by yourselves.

399
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,040
Let's go that way.

400
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,720
Wait for me here.

401
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,040
Got it?

402
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,320
Stay here.

403
01:45:09,034 --> 01:45:11,531
You wanna stay with me?

404
01:45:14,525 --> 01:45:16,485
Stick out your tonque.

405
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,440
Behave!

406
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,456
Lie down.

407
01:45:55,331 --> 01:45:56,341
Sit.

408
01:45:58,796 --> 01:46:00,300
Sit down!

409
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,421
You wanna stay with me, right?

410
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,461
Help me.

411
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,311
I'm sorry.

412
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,991
I'm sorry.
